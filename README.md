# jester-config

hi! i learn vim motions three weeks ago from 04/24/24, and now i setup my neovim configs!

this github page will show off my neovim config, and i will update it as i learn more about vimscript and neovim. :)

## files to edit upon new language

- lsp-config (lsps using mason)
  ~~treesitter~~
- none-ls (formatters and linters using mason)

## issues

- clangd && cpplint has contrasting opinions, edit clangd configurations
- implement a debugger (no idea how to)

## v1 04/24/24

- 43 plugins

![Version 1](assets/version1nvim.png)

### v1.1 (4/24/24):

- added hardtime to get rid of bad habits

### v1.2 (4/26/24):

- rehauled lspconfigs, realized they weren't doing shit and i wasn't using half of the keymaps provided so i decided to ball and redid practically everything. stored it in bak/
- kept hardtimelearner in .bak for temporary on and off usages
- most likely going to organize all my lua files eventually, they're all kind of a mess and i'm debating how to organize my keymaps considering they're the biggest mess of it all
- took around 6 hours to properly get everything working, i'd say **v1.2** is the first working version of my nvim configs LOL
